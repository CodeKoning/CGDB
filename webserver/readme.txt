Corporate Governance Database

This allows a user to peruse a few of the most valuable companies in the Fortune 500, see who their founders and governors are and see where they attended university. They can peruse by clicking hyperlinks or by searching any of the entities in the database by entering their name in the search field at the top of the page. The goal is to inform the user by showing them the how closely related many of these people are, by showing that many of them attend the same univesities, hold the same degrees and even serve on the boards of multiple companies at the same time.

**NOTES FOR TA/PROF**

Searching currently does not support partial or misspelled entries. Please enter the exact search query by entering the names of any of the following entities:

These companies have the most comprehensive information at the moment and Microsoft and Amazon will exhibit the subsidiary_of relationship the best.

The same can be said for these universities:

Harvard
University of Pennsylvania
Stanford
